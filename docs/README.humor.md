Absolutely! Adding emojis can enhance the humor and make the documentation more visually engaging. Here’s the revised version with strategically placed emojis:

### **How to use the script?** 🛠️

There are two ways to deploy this magnificent tool.

#### **Invocation** 🚀

Run it straight from this GitHub Repository. Here’s your magic incantation: 🧙‍♂️

```bash
curl --connect-timeout 10 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charystag/markdown_links_checker/master/check_links.sh | bash -s -- doc1.md doc2.md ... docN.md
```

Where `doc1`...`docN` are your markdown documents, eagerly waiting to be validated. 📄✨

Or, if you’re feeling adventurous, try this: 🏴‍☠️

```bash
curl --connect-timeout 10 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charystag/markdown_links_checker/master/check_links.sh | bash -s -- -i ignored doc1.md doc2.md ... docN.md
```

Where `ignored` is a special file that lists all those “don’t even bother” URLs. Handy for when you just want to live your best life. 😎✌️

#### **Installation** 🖥️

Want a more permanent relationship? Install the script with: 💍

```bash
curl --connect-timeout 10 -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charystag/markdown_links_checker/master/assets/install.sh | bash -s -- $SHELL
```

Now you’re all set! Just summon it with: 🧞‍♂️

```bash
markdown-links-checker doc1.md doc2.md ... docN.md
```

### **Why this script?** 🤔

Because I, your friendly neighborhood developer, have been generating mountains of content with ChatGPT. But guess what? Some of the links were duds, leading to the dreaded “404 Not Found” abyss. 🚧🕳️ After a few of these, I decided: "Enough is enough!" 💪 And voila, this script was born to rescue all markdown documents from the perils of broken links. 🛡️

---

### **How it works** 🕵️‍♂️

Here’s the wizardry behind the curtain: 🎩✨

1. It sniffs out all the http(s) URLs disguised as markdown links. 👃🔗
2. For each URL, it performs a `curl` spell to check the response code: 🌀
   - If the response code starts with a 2 (like 200), it's a thumbs-up! 👍 The link is alive and kicking. 💃
   - If not, the link’s probably in trouble, and we make a note of it. 🚨✍️
3. It sends the results to `stdout` if all’s good, or `stderr` if things went south. 🖥️🚑

---

### **Technical Considerations** 🧠

Heads up! ⚠️ Our little script isn’t a fan of escaped parentheses in URLs right now. Yeah, it’s a bit of a diva. 👑 Until we train it better, you might want to sidestep those with the `-i` option. 🚶‍♂️

### **Demo Video** 🎬

Coming soon! Stay tuned for the blockbuster that’ll show you exactly how to master the art of markdown link checking. 🍿🎥

With these added emojis, the documentation not only reads more playfully but also visually stands out, making key points even more engaging. If you’d like any further tweaks or have more content to work on, feel free to let me know!
